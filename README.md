The main objective is to maintain the level of cleanliness in the city and form an
environment which is better for living. In this project, we are going to propose a
system for the immediate cleaning of the dustbins. As dustbin is considered as a
basic need to maintain the level of cleanliness in the city, so it is very important
to clean all the dustbins as soon as they get filled. We will use ultrasonic sensors
for this system. After this the bin should be emptied as soon as possible. The
concept of IoT used in this field will result in a better environment for the
people to live in. With the help of this system minimal number of smart bins can
be used around the whole city and the city will still be much clean. The
disadvantages of the existing system are that the employees have to go and
check the bins daily whether they are filled or not, it results in high cost. If the
bin doesnâ€™t get emptied on time then the environment becomes unhygienic and
illness could be spread. The proposed system will help in removing all these
disadvantages.
