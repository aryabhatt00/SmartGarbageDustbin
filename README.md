# Smart Garbage Dustbin

## Abstract:
Nowadays, actions are being taken to improve the level of cleanliness in the country. People are becoming more active in doing all they can to clean their surroundings, and various movements have been started by the government to increase cleanliness. This project proposes a system that will notify the corporations to empty the dustbins on time. Ultrasonic sensors placed on top of the dustbins will measure the garbage level inside them. Once the garbage reaches the maximum level, a notification will be sent to the corporation’s office, prompting employees to empty the bin. This system will help maintain cleanliness more efficiently by reducing manual checks and ensuring timely garbage disposal.

## Introduction:
The **Internet of Things (IoT)** refers to the network of connected physical objects that can communicate and exchange data without human intervention. Any object in the physical world that can be assigned an IP address to enable data transmission over a network can be part of an IoT system, embedded with sensors, software, and networking gear. This project proposes a system for **immediate cleaning of dustbins** using **ultrasonic sensors**. The system reduces the need for manual checks by notifying when bins are full, thus maintaining cleanliness and hygiene in the city.

## Motivation:
The primary objective is to maintain cleanliness in the city and create a better living environment. Employees can check the status of dustbins anytime via their mobile phones, making this system more efficient. The current system requires employees to manually check if bins are full, resulting in high costs and inefficiency. By using IoT, the system reduces manual work, improves sanitation, and reduces operational costs. The future version of this system could integrate other types of sensors for more precise output.
